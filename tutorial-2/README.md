This intitial tutorial is a Hello World for CAS.  It will verify you have your prerequisites set up, and understand the basics of setting up a CAS server, and casifying an application.

The idea is to set up a CAS server that allows log in via one user name: CatAdmirer with password: ST.Ciqc!
This password uses the every first letter of a sentence plus punction method.  The orginal sentence was Scrodinger T. Cat is quantum cool!

Then casify the overpoweringly-cute-cat app so that only a logged in user can get to the protected area.
