This tutorial 4 for the Damn Vulnerable Overpoweringly Cute Cat App.

In this tutorial start by looking for an insecure direct object references in the webapp.  Then correct that using OWASP's esapi AcceessReferenceMap.

Second, look for a common Java web application security misconfiguration.  Correct that security misconfiguration.
Hint: One misconfiguration would have been obvious in tutorial 2.

Sample, corrections are in the example-corrections folder.

For the third exercise in this tutorial map out all the sensitive data in the application, and decide how that data should be protected.  The next tutorial will cover cryptography in more depth and the correction for this exercise will be looked at then.

Please visit OWASP for additional information, and check out the slides for this tutorial.
